                                <li><i>Web beacon</i> is a small, transparent image (also known as “pixel tag”, “web bug”, “GIF”) that contains a unique identifier. It is embedded into a website or an email. When your browser reads the code of the website
                                    it communicates with our server in order to display the image and, through this process, we are able to acquire information such as technical specifications of your device, operating systems and settings being used.
                                    It can also track your activities during a session. Also, it enables us to recognize when each email was opened, from what IP address and from what device. We use this information to improve our email communication.</li>
                                <li><i>Software development kits (SDK)</i> are third-party software development kits that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain
                                    information about the device and network you use to access the application.</li>
                                <li><i>Local shared objects</i>, commonly called “Flash cookies”, are pieces of data that websites which use Adobe Flash may store on a user's computer to facilitate the Flash functionality. We may use Adobe Flash to display
                                    graphics, interactive animations and other enhanced functionality. Local shared objects can track similar parameters to cookies but they can also provide information on your use of the specific feature that the cookie
                                    is enabling. For example, if it facilitates the display of a video then we can receive details of how much of the video was watched and when viewing stopped. Flash cookie management tools can be accessed directly via
                                    www.adobe.com.</li>
                                <li><i>HTML5 local storage.</i> HTML 5 is the fifth version of the HTML language and contains functionality that allows information to be stored locally within the browser’s data files. HTML5 local storage operates in a similar
                                    way to cookies but differs in that it can hold greater amounts of information and does not rely on an exchange of data with the website’s server.</li>
                                <li><i>Fingerprinting</i> is a technique that involves combining a set of information elements in order to uniquely identify a particular device. These information elements include, for example: data from configuration of the
                                    device, CSS information, JavaScript objects, installed fonts, installed plugins with the browser, use of any APIs, HTTP header information, clock information.</li>
                                <li><i>Device Identifiers</i> are identifiers comprised of numbers and letters, which are unique to each specific device. These include Apple’s ID for Advertisers (IDFA) and Google’s Android Advertising ID (AAID). They are stored
                                    on the device and are used to recognize you and your devices across different apps and devices for marketing and advertising purposes. You can reset your device identifier or opt out of personalized advertising in the
                                    settings of your device.</li>
