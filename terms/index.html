                                vacancies. We don’t input into the hiring or selection processes, and are not a recruitment firm, we simply index available vacancies published by others and when you choose to apply for a vacancy you will be redirected
                                to the original job post on the third party site or service directly or using our easy apply service. We also offer lots of tips and hints to job seekers, and have newsletters and other informative content. Some features
                                of the Site include the ability for job seekers to upload a CV, create a CV, or simply get alerts about new posts in careers that are of interest to you. We also offer recruiters opportunities to broadcast their vacancies
                                with us through collaboration. Collectively our activities, products and features on the Site and the Site itself, are referenced in this Policy as the “Services”.
